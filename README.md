# NextJS EasyWeb boilerplate

## Work-in-progress

Next-easyweb (sorry, didn't had time too look for a good name) aims to be a configurable template system to build simple landing pages on top of nextjs.
Right now, only a bare bones dashboard is available and an example page with a few UI components.
